When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    The remote repository is more dynamic to the flux of the code, accessible from the any place quickly, so it's rather.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pull manually is might because doing this i can keep control over the changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks makes a copy of a git from a gitHub profile to another gitHub profile; Clones makes a copy of a git from a gitHub profile to Local Directory; Branches are "heads" of alternative lines of code, parallel to master code. Forks are used to obtain code from another gitHub Profile in my profile, clones ares in my local directory and branches can be used ever I want to works on a code without change the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Keeping this I avoid conflicts when I commit.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I'd collabore sending changes in a lot of different files and it would ber harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Make branchs separately turns the coding more social (merging codes from others collaborers) and more secure to try new ideas without to change the master code.
